# Dossier — Verified study content for Last Day Words unlocks
Researched: 2026-07-09 · Shelf life: EGW/KJV historical (stable); Supabase/PWA APIs recheck if upgrading major versions

## 1 · Direct answer
Enough verified Education + Great Controversy passages were extracted from the user PDFs to populate mastery unlocks, perfect-solve bonuses, and 10 mystery fragments without inventing EGW wording. Confidence: HIGH for EGW extracts and for the 12 KJV phrases corroborated in kjv.pdf.

## 2 · Key findings (ranked by confidence)
- **FACT** EGW Education ch.1 and ch.20 passages exist at the cited PDF pages [ledger 1–3].
- **FACT** GC passages on second advent, latter rain, seal, loud cry (Rev 18), sanctuary/judgment, and Sunday/image themes exist at cited pages [ledger 4–12].
- **FACT** Supabase JS `auth.signUp` / password auth and vite-plugin-pwa `autoUpdate` are current documented APIs [ledger 13–14].
- **INFERENCE** Based on ledger 1–12, chapter-themed unlock mapping in `src/data/studyContent.ts` is appropriate for this game’s 10 chapters.
- **FACT** Twelve load-bearing KJV phrases used in unlocks/UI were found in kjv.pdf at the cited pages [ledger 15].

## 3 · Disputed & conflicting
None.

## 4 · Gaps — what could not be verified
- Not every scripture string in `words.ts` was exhaustively re-scanned against kjv.pdf — only the 12 phrases listed in ledger #15.
- Exact print-edition page numbers vs PDF page indices may differ by front-matter offset; locators use PDF page numbers from pypdf.

## 5 · Detail sections
See `src/data/studyContent.ts` for the passages wired into the app.
